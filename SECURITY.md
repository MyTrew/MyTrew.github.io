## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

If you find a vulnerability and have the ability to fix it please make a request and I'll check it and approve it. If not then make it aware there is a vulnerability by providing information about it and sending me a message with the details.

## Updates ##

Do not expect a regular schedule for this repository. I will make attempts to keep it updated when I have time and get a security notification but I will not be constantly on this as this is not a serious project at the moment. Thank you for your support.
