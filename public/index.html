    <p>Hi Dad,

        Sorry you have been feeling under the weather lately. Hopefully this game will cheer you up a bit. The rules are simple. Guess the selected random number between 1 and 100. See if you can guess it in 10 turns or fewer. I'll tell you if your guess was too high or too low. Goodluck. Love you.
      </p>
